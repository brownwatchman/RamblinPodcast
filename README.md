# Hello world!

This is a basic website that was created for the "Introduction to HTML & CSS" course for Tooele Tech's Software Development course. üíª
I created a fake podcast with the purpose of designing this website. 

## What's in this project? 

‚Üê `README.md`: That's this file.

‚Üê `index.html`: This is the main web page for my site. The HTML defines the structure and content of the page using _elements_. You'll see references in the HTML to the JS and CSS files. Try clicking the image in the center of the page!

‚Üê `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to your content. The CSS applies styles to the elements in your HTML page. The style rules also make the image move when you click it.

‚Üê `script.js`: If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript. The code in the JavaScript file runs when the page loads, and when the visitor clicks the button you can add using the code in the TODO.

Open each file and check out the comments (in gray) for more info.
